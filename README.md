# OOP-Example
Object Oriented Programming

** Inheritance is when a class inherits behavior from another class. The class that is inheriting behavior is called the subclass and the class it inherits from is called the superclass.

** A subclass can override a superclassâ€™s method, using the super() method for e.g. speak in this program

** Abstraction: Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.
